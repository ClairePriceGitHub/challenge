# SEO and Accessibility 

## Description

In this project I put into practice refactoring skills in relation to HTML and CSS, ensuring website functionality was maintained. 
Using HTML starter code which contained numerous div tags, the code was refactored to use semantic HTML tags and image alt attributes, to improve website accessibility and seo.

In terms of the CSS starter code, the selectors and properties were consolidated and organised to follow the updated HTML structure, and along with the HTML code, have been organised to follow industry standards.

On completion of this project my knowledge of semantic HTML tags, HTML in general and CSS methodology has improved.
